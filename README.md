# micromouse_2022

The primary objective of the project is to design and build an efficient and intelligent robot capable of navigating through an unknown maze, seeking the shortest path from the starting point to the center of the maze. The project aims to combine aspects of robotics, software development, and artificial intelligence to create a functional and competitive Micromouse.
